# Project Description

The project consists of modeling and providing a computational solution to the DHL Supply Chain case written by Singfat Chu and David Ringrose. The degradation of the environment has led many governments and customers to pressure businesses to make their operations more nature friendly. This case illustrates an effective example of corporate social responsibility. Specifically, it demonstrates how a small increase in a supply chain budget can drastically reduce carbon dioxide (ùê∂ùëÇ2) emission in the transportation of LCD TVs from their manufacturing bases to a distribution centre.

The goal of this project is to make a recommendation for the company and provide a report including a plan about how the company can reduce CO2 emissions without raising the supply chain budget too much.

I decided to add the use of Gurobi API in Phyton to perform linear programming formulation. The linear programming is formulated such that it minimizes the  ùê∂ùëÇ2  emission while satisfying the budget constraint and other constraints in this project.

# What's inside my Repository

Inside my Repo, I will be including:

1. [Report](https://github.com/iw30/IEOR162/blob/main/IEOR%20162%20Project%20Fall%20'20.pdf): 
The report consists of two parts: The first part contains an executive summary and a main body where I give and explain my results in a very simple way so that anyone can understand it. In addition, the report include a number of recommendations and corresponding argumentation on how to reduce the CO2 emission. The second part, the technical part, should be prepared as an appendix to the first part. In this part, I explain all the details of my model(s) and solutions to the problem. I will provide an additional technical explanation behind my recommendations: address my formulation and its correctness in view of relevant assumptions; explore my model‚Äôs sensitivity to assumptions and parameters; apply appropriate solution techniques and software for the optimization problem. Note that this project uses AMPL as the optimization language.

2. [Phyton Code](https://github.com/iw30/IEOR162/blob/main/DHL.ipynb): This is the Phyton code for this project. I mainly used Gurobi to perform the mathematical optimization model.
